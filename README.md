Main Page URL: localhost:8000/posts


Commands (bash):
php artisan db:seed -> adds 10 placeholder posts to database


Brief:
I initially had trouble setting up the environment of the program. Having to update the version of laravel to version 11, installing composer but not having the proper php installed etc.

Apart from that, my approach was simply to follow along what was taught in the lectures, looking online for anything else that I needed more clarification on.
